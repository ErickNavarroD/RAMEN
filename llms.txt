# RAMEN

## Overview

Regional Association of Methylome variability with the Exposome and
geNome (RAMEN) is an R package whose goal is to identify Variable
Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarray DNA methylation data.
Additionally, using Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can
identify which G, E, G+E or GxE model better explains this variability.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RAMEN from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ErickNavarroD/RAMEN")
```

## Core functions

RAMEN consists of six main functions:

- [`findVMRs()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/findVMRs.md)
  identifies Variable Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarrays
- [`summarizeVMRs()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/summarizeVMRs.md)summarizes
  the regional methylation state of each VMR
- [`findCisSNPs()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/findCisSNPs.md)
  identifies the SNPs in *cis* of each VMR
- [`selectVariables()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/selectVariables.md)
  conducts a LASSO-based variable selection strategy to identify
  potentially relevant *cis* SNPs and environmental variables
- [`lmGE()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/lmGE.md)
  fits linear single-variable genetic (G) and environmental (E), and
  pairwise additive (G+E) and interaction (GxE) linear models and select
  the best explanatory model per VMR.
- [`nullDistGE()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/nullDistGE.md)
  simulates a delta R squared null distribution of G and E effects on
  DNAme variability. Useful for filtering out poor-performing best
  explanatory models selected by *lmGE()*.

Altogether, these functions create a pipeline that takes a set of
individuals with genotype, environmental exposure and DNA methylation
information, and generates an estimation of the contribution of the
genotype and environment to its DNA methylation variability. Functions
that conduct computationally intensive tasks are compatible with
parallel computing.

## Usage

For a detailed tutorial on how to use RAMEN, please check the package’s
vignette or
[website](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/articles/RAMEN.html).

## Variations to the standard workflow

Besides using RAMEN for completing the analysis mentioned above, the
package provides individual functions that could help users in other
tasks, such as:

- Reduction of tests prior to an EWAS or differential methylation
  analysis (i.e., conducting the analyses on identified VMRs to reduce
  redundant tests by grouping nearby correlated CpGs and to avoid tests
  in non-variant regions)
- Fit additive and interaction models given a set of variables of
  interest and select the best explanatory model for DNAme data.
- Quickly identify SNPs in *cis* of CpG probes for variable reduction
  during mQTL analyses.
- Get the median correlation of probes in regions of interest (with
  [`medCorVMR()`](https://ericknavarrod.github.io/RAMEN/reference/medCorVMR.md)).
