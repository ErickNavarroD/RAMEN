## Introduction

Regional Association of Methylation variability with genotype and
ENvironment (RAMEN) is an R package whose goal is to identify Variable
Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarray DNA methylation data.
Additionally, using Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can
identify which G, E, G + E or GxE model better explains this
variability.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RAMEN from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ErickNavarroD/RAMEN")
```

## Core functions

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(RAMEN)
## basic example code
```

## Variations to the standard workflow
