## Introduction
Regional Association of Methylation variability with genotype and ENvironment (RAMEN) is an R package whose goal is to identify Variable Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarray methylation data. Additionally, using Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can identify which G, E, G + E or GxE model explains better this variability.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RAMEN from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ErickNavarroD/RAMEN")
```
