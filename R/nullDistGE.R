#' Simulate a delta R squared null distribution of G and E effects on DNAme variability
#'
#' This function simulates the delta R squared distribution under the null hypothesis of G and E having no association with DNA mehtylation (DNAme) variability through a permutation analysis. To do so, this function shuffles the G and E variables in the dataset, which is followed by a the variable selection and modelling steps with *selectVariables()* and *lmGE()*.These steps are repeated several times as indicated in the *permutations* parameter. By using shuffled G and E data, we simulate the increase of R2 that would be observed in random data using the RAMEN methodology.
#'
#' The core pipeline from the RAMEN package identifies the best explanatory model per VMR. However, despite these models being winners in comparison to models including any other G/E variable(s) in the dataset, some winning models might perform no better than what we would expect by chance. Therefore, the goal of this function is to create a distribution of increase in R2 under the null hypothesis of G and E having no associations with DNAme. The null distribution is obtained through shuffling the G and E variables in a given dataset and conducting the variable selection and G/E model selection. That way, we can simulate how much additional variance would be explained by the models defined as winners by the RAMEN methodology in a scenario where the G and E associations with DNAme are randomized. This distribution can be then used to filter out winning models in the non-shuffled dataset that do not add more to the explained variance of the basal model than what randomized data do.
#'
#' Under the assumption that after adjusting for the concomitant variables all VMRs across the genome follow the same behavior regarding an increment of explained variance with randomized G and E data, we can pool the delta R squared values from all VMRs to create a null distribution taking advantage of the high number of VMRs in the dataset. This assumption decreases significantly the number of permutations required to create a null distribution and reduces the computational time. For further information please read the RAMEN paper (in preparation).
