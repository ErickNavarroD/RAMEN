abstract: >
  Regional Association of Methylome variability with the
  Exposome and geNome (RAMEN) is an R package whose goal is
  to identify Variable Methylated Regions (VMRs) in
  microarray DNA methylation data. Additionally, using
  Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can identify
  which G, E, G+E or GxE model better explains this
  variability.
